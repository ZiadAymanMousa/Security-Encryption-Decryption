# Security-Encryption-Decryption
This project is an implementation of various encryption and decryption algorithms in C# to provide secure data communication. The implementation includes algorithms such as RSA, AES, HILL Cipher, Ceaser, PlayFair,... These algorithms are widely used in cryptography and are used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during transmission
