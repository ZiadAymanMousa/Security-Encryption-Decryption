# Security-Encryption-Decryption
This project is an implementation of various encryption and decryption algorithms in C# to provide secure data communication. The implementation includes algorithms such as RSA, AES, HILL Cipher, Ceaser, PlayFair,... These algorithms are widely used in cryptography and are used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access during transmission
The RSA algorithm is a widely-used public-key encryption algorithm that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of RSA in this project involves generating public and private keys, encrypting and decrypting data using these keys, and verifying the authenticity of the data using digital signatures.

The AES algorithm is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of AES in this project involves generating a secret key, encrypting and decrypting data using this key, and verifying the authenticity of the data using message authentication codes.

The HILL Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of HILL Cipher in this project involves generating a key matrix, encrypting and decrypting data using this matrix, and verifying the authenticity of the data using message authentication codes.

The Ceaser Cipher is a substitution cipher that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of Ceaser Cipher in this project involves generating a key, encrypting anddecrypting data using this key, and verifying the authenticity of the data using message authentication codes.

The PlayFair Cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of PlayFair Cipher in this project involves generating a key, creating a key grid, encrypting and decrypting data using this grid, and verifying the authenticity of the data using message authentication codes.

The RepeatingKeyVigenere Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. The implementation of RepeatingKeyVigenere Cipher in this project involves generating a key, encrypting and decrypting data using this key, and verifying the authenticity of the data using message authentication codes.

The Monoalphabetic Cipher is a substitution cipher that is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
